# Concept

Investment opportunities explorer should be built and move forward by the community's suggestion to make it more usable.
We accept all community members suggesting the idea, and we will be giving token rewards to the valid suggestions.

## Initial design

We were going to ask users to provide investment opportunities information as part of information NFT and integrate information verifiers there.
But it involves lots of interactions and several holes. To avoid this, we decided to find a better way by crowd-sourcing the idea.

## New thought1 by Gopher

Build a coinmarketcap / coingecko like platform focusing on investment information. Currently coin listing platforms are not sorted by potentials.
Therefore it's not easy to select what has biggest potential and what to select exactly for investment.
We are trying to give best interface here and sort them to give community members best UX and reduce time on research.
We are planning to provide pitch deck style report for each project. And the project's recent development updates, launchdates etc to let user to not miss opportunities.

## What kind of interface community users want to minimize the time they spend to make accurate decisions in selecting the right project?

Please create issue tickets here with detailed features. We are planning to provide 500K QSTK tokens for valid suggestions.
If you agree on coingecko style dashboard, what kind of features could be done as a first stage? You can create issue tickets on this repo.
